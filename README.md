# 👋 Hi there!

## 📌 About

👋 Hi, I’m Ronak Fathi — a statistical consultant and educator with a master’s degree in mathematical statistics. I specialize in probability, stochastic modeling, simulation, and applied statistical analysis using R, Python, and SPSS.

Across my work—whether analyzing random recursive trees, forecasting customer behavior, environmental phenomena, or modeling health and behavioral outcomes—I focus on understanding dependence, uncertainty, and variation in complex systems.

My applied projects span health, psychology, economics, environment, and education, with experience in forecasting, risk modeling, and behavioral analytics.

I’m currently exploring interdisciplinary applications of statistical modeling and machine learning, and I’m eager to collaborate on projects where rigorous quantitative methods inform real-world decision-making.
