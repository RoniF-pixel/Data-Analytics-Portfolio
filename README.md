I have an analytical background in Statistics and few years of experience in teaching and guiding undergraduate students on choosing most suited statistical techniques for their data projects. Currently, I am on track to acquiring more skills in Machine Learning field. I have developed a strong foundation in Statistics and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights in the field of Health care. I am also excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an intermediate-level data specialist.
